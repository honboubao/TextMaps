# Scripts used for downloading product pages

## Software needed

- phantomjs
- python

## Download product pages from eshop
Run following script:

```Shell
phantomjs download_shop.js [FILE_WITH_URL] [PATH_TO_DATA_DIR] [PREFIX]
#example: phantomjs download_shop.js shop_urls/alza.txt ../data_shops alza) 
```

## Semi-automatic labeling of DOM elements 
Run following script:

python labelling.py [prefix]

Script creates new directory "labeled_dom_trees" which contains copy of DOM trees with labeled elements.

## Review labeled results

We review labeled results by checking image patches of labeled elements. The process is divided into 3 steps - prepare labeled patches, review them, remove them.

### Step 1: Prepare patches
    ```Shell
    python review.py prepare [prefix]
    ```

### Step 2: Review patches
    ```Shell
    python review.py review [prefix]
    ```

You can select wrongly labeled patches, in order to remove page from dataset. If everything goes right, the script creates new file in "page_sets" directory,
which contains all pages that passed the review process.

### Step 3: Remove patches
    ```Shell
    python review.py remove alza
    ```
